# Star of The Abyss

This is a Unity-based game project developed during the first year of my university studies as part of a group assignment. The project involved collaboration through Git, with multiple contributors working on different features and systems.

> Please note: This repository is a hard copy of the original group repository. I initially attempted to fork and rebase it properly, but due to some complications with Git history and merge conflicts, I opted to clone it instead for the sake of keeping a clean local working copy. I'm still in the process of improving my Git workflow and version control practices.
