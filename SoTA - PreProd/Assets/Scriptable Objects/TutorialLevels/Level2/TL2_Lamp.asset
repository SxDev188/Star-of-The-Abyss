  dialogueInfo:
  - dialouge: The pillars with Stars on top of them act like sort of lamps.
  - dialouge: You can turn them on by throwing your Star at them. When they are active,
      they will emit the same kind of color revealing glow as your Star.
  - dialouge: This can be helpful on some levels to easier keep track of what objects
      are color connected.
