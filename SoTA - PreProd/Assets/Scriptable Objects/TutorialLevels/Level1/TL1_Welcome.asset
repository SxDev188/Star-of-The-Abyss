  dialogueInfo:
  - dialouge: 'Welcome to the Abyss and the first tutorial level! '
  - dialouge: Move with W, A, S and D, or if using a gamepad the Left Stick.
  - dialouge: What you just interacted with is a lore tile, they give useful tips
      and hints.
  - dialouge: The glowing object on top of you is a Star.
  - dialouge: The Star is keeping you alive in this dark abyssmal place, so don't
      leave it for too long or you'll die.
  - dialouge: The glow from the Star reveals color, so you can see color connections
      between objects.
  - dialouge: "You can drop the Star with the space bar, or the North button on your
      gamepad. \nYou can also recall the Star to you in the same way if you are close
      enough."
  - dialouge: You can throw the Star to interact with things.
  - dialouge: "Press the Left Mouse Button, aim by pulling the mouse back, and release
      to throw. \nWith a gamepad, aim with the Right Stick and push the Right Trigger
      to throw."
  - dialouge: Every time you throw the Star, your progress will be saved. So if you
      do end up dying, you will revert back to the last time you threw the Star.
